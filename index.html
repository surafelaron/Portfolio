      <h2>Hello:</h2>

      <p>My name is Surafel Ferede and I am aspiring to be a Software developer any time soon!!</p>

      <p>I previously work on hospitality industry mainly on a tourism sector as tour operator and tour manager! but always has an interest in the technology industry. Started to teach my self about how http protocol work about two and half years ago. And continue learning other parts of programing. Recently I joined a bootcamp to nail whatever is left from myself teaching. through this time I have aquired pretty decent skill on becoming full stack developer. javascript is my main focus area of this learning. I skilled on OOP and node.js to mention few! I have participated on making travel assisting application project(linked below), which was exciting and challenging.</p>
